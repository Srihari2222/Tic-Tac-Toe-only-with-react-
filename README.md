# Description

This is a React based Tic Tac Toe Game designed to get an hands on experience with "React" and "WEB sockets". This mini-application is built using raw html 
and css and also a bunch of code from bootstrap. This app has three features where a user can play this game with a offline player  and also a online player which is developed using web sockets and also have a feature where he/she can play with the computer.

# Scripts present in application.

It contains react components file and their respective css files. Also it has a main App.js file which renders the components and give a single-page experience to the user. This is a simple application which covers some basic and important concepts in react like useStates, useEffects, etc.. and a complex steps with socket.io library which is connected with frontend using express.js and node.js

# Main discussion.

The development ofthe application took hardly about 2 days. Because the main focus is on the logic written in the Game.js and the Computer.js files. Also the designing of css took an effective amount of time.

If you are reading this readme, then I like to mention the main challenges faced by me or can be said like the error handling was:

1.The trouble in changing the states on the turns made by the computer.
2.Next, the alignment of the css components to make it responsive.
3.The render and change of useStates hook in the application.
4.The adding and deleting the classes in html on condition basis.
5.Routing all the componets.
6.The main confusions are with the web sockets and the asynchronous nature of javascript which I will replace with typescript in the future.

# Final Conclusion.

This was a basic project to me. And I suggest you that building a project is a different task and building it with some complex technologies is the other task.
